Tons and tons of things I wouldn't normally do in this project but I'm trying not to do things that the course hasn't covered yet.

I couldn't help myself and I did make one function for updating the label with an error message and I used a `[Flags]` enum for the toppings since doing it with just a bunch of raw if/else statements was too much.

But, still, everything else is in one big function, there are magic numbers everywhere, presentation and logic are mixed together, and on and on.
